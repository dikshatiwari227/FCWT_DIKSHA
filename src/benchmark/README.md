# CWT BENCHMARK 

In this folder you can find the MATLAB, MATHEMATICA and Python files used in the CWT benchmark. 
The benchmark has been performed on a MacBook Pro 2019 having a 2,3 GHz Intel Core i9, 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4.

## Programs used
- MATLAB v2019b
- MATHEMATICA 12.0.0.0 (Mac OSX x86)
- Python 3.8.6

## Python dependencies
- PyWavelets version 1.1.1
- Scipy version 1.5.2
- Numpy version 1.19.2

## Running times
In the benchmark MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, PyWavelet and Scipy ran in 18.28s, 38.86s, 12.59s, and 19.56s respectively.

## Benchmark reproduction
The benchmark has been performed with N=100000 samples. This has already been defined in all files, so running them
would reproduce benchmark results.
